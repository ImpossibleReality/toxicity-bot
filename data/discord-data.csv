"Hello Admins & Mods!

It‚Äôs official. 2022 is the year of communities. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve been investing in ways to make it easier to start, grow, and protect your communities on Discord. 

Today, we‚Äôre unveiling new tools and resources fresh from our labs so let‚Äôs dive in.

**It‚Äôs Easy To Keep Your Community And Conversations Clean With AutoMod**

Meet AutoMod, your new best friend in moderation. Designed to reduce work and stress for moderators, AutoMod comes equipped with keyword filters to help keep your server clean and safe around the clock by automatically filtering out harmful or undesirable messages before they‚Äôre posted. Enjoy newfound peace of mind, even when you‚Äôre offline.

Enable AutoMod in **Server Settings > AutoMod**. Once the wheels are turning‚Ä¶

:dot: Choose from readily available keyword filters or customize your own with lists of words or phrases and the actions AutoMod will take when they‚Äôre found in your server.
:dot: AutoMod‚Äôs keyword filters can automatically detect, block, and alert you of messages containing harmful words or phrases‚Äîbefore they‚Äôre ever posted.
:dot: Receive alerts from AutoMod when members try to use words from your lists and assign actions like Timeout from the alert itself.
:dot: Add **Wildcards** to your keywords to detect variations of words that partially match those on your lists. 
     <:bluedot:915338133070032997> `bake*` ‚áí Today, we **bake**d some coffee cake
     <:bluedot:915338133070032997> `*milk` ‚áí I add soy**milk** to my coffee

<:dot:890738617130037318> Many of your favorite moderation bots support monitoring *Text Chat in Voice Channels* and Discord‚Äôs new AutoMod can automatically detect and flag undesirable messages and rule-breakers before they are posted; helping you keep conversations clean and giving you time to focus on the fun parts of managing your community: (AutoMod Help Center article here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4421269296535-AutoMod-FAQ).

We can‚Äôt wait to see how you make the most of *Text Chat In Voice Channels*.",0
"Hey Admins & Mods,

Beginning Wednesday, 6/1 we‚Äôre rolling out **Text Chat in Voice Channels** to Discord. With embedded chat in voice channels, your community can send messages, GIFs, links, memes, etc. to everyone in the voice channel‚Äîno more clogging <#687068339989905449>.

**We are rolling out Text Chat in Voice Channels slowly to all servers throughout the week. Initially, it will not be enabled by default for servers that have greater than 200 members or are set as a Community Server.**

But once you have access‚Ä¶
<:dot:843249351291043851> You‚Äôll have a new Server Settings tab on the web or your client called *Text in Voice*.
<:dot:843249351291043851> Turn Text Chat in Voice Channels on for your community by selecting *Enable*.
<:dot:843249351291043851> Customize permissions for your community, like enabling in specific voice channels or disabling for certain roles. Most developers of your favorite moderation bots have already updated their instances to monitor Text Chat in Voice Channels!

For more details on *Text Chat in Voice Channels*, read our Help Center article here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359

In four weeks, Text Chat in Voice Channels will be automatically enabled for all servers while still respecting your prescribed permissions‚Äîbut we recommend you enable it early for all your server members to enjoy!",0
"Hello Admin & Mods!

Today, we have a new update for slash commands in your servers: **Permissions!** If you don‚Äôt know, slash commands are a new, easier way to use bots on Discord. You might already have some to use‚Äîtype `/` to find out!

With this new system, you can:
<:dot:843249351291043851>Control who can use slash commands in your servers
<:dot:843249351291043851>Control in which channels commands can be used
<:dot:843249351291043851>Sync or unsync commands like channels and categories, making mass management and special cases easy to handle

You can find these permissions in **Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Pick an app!** If the app supports slash commands, you‚Äôll see the UI.

‚ö†Ô∏è If a bot you use has integrated slash commands, the old way of denying the bot Read Messages **will not work to moderate commands usage.** You‚Äôll need to use this new system to control access.

Not sure if your bots support slash commands? Check out in **Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations**, or just **type `/`!**

"Hey Community Admins and Moderators, 

üïê  **Timeout feature is now live to all communities**

We're excited to share a better way for moderators to temporarily stop a member from interacting in their server! Members in timeout will not be able to reply, react, message or join voice for a set period of time. 

<:dot:843249351291043851> Only Members with `Timeout Members` permission can time others out. This is default-off, so **Owners+Admins will need to grant permission to others**. Go to ""Server Settings"" > Roles. 
<:dot:843249351291043851> Anyone can timeout another member with a role below their own if they have the permission. 
<:dot:843249351291043851>Members who leave and re-join the server will still be in timeout. 
<:dot:843249351291043851> Members in timeout need to upgrade to latest client version to see the time remaining in their timeout. You may need to manually update to latest iOS and Android clients.

"Hey Community Admins & Mods! It's time for another update:

** üìÜ Events feature is now live to all servers**
We're excited to share a better way to organize raid nights, study groups, trivia nights, or your next holiday gathering. You'll now be able to create and schedule Events that are directly displayed in your server. Members can RSVP, share, and will also be notified when the event starts. 
    - Events can be in Voice channels, Stage channels, or in a ""free-form"" location (Twitch link, IRL, a text channel). 
    - Only Members with `Manage Events` permission can create Events. This is default-off, so admins will need to grant it to others.
    - The Events tab only shows to Members if there is an upcoming event. 
    - Both Community and non-Community servers can utilize Events.
    - HC Article here: https://dis.gd/events

 **<:Partner:847224325697437716> Applications are open for the Discord Partner Program**
We love to support communities that invest time and effort on Discord‚Äîinterested in joining the pack? Apply now and get rewarded for creating an engaged community with our Partner Program. https://dis.gd/partnerapps
    - As a server with Community settings enabled, you can apply in-app on the Partner Program tab if your server meets our requirements.
    - Once your application is received, your community will be reviewed based on quantitative and qualitative factors to see if it's a great fit for Partnership. Meeting the requirements to apply doesn't guarantee acceptance. 
    - Best of luck to all you aspiring Partners out there!

Thanks for reading!",0
"Hey Community Admins & Mods! 

We‚Äôve got some exciting and important updates that we wanted to share with you today. Hopefully these updates are valuable in helping you build and create world class communities here on Discord.

**‚≠ê __Custom Role Icons__**

We‚Äôve just introduced our newest perk to **Level 2 Boosting - custom role icons**, which gives you a fun way to customize and distinguish roles in your server. You‚Äôll be able to see this new feature on both desktop and mobile, but you‚Äôll need to use desktop to set, change, or delete icons for now!

Icons for each role will display in the members list and next to each member's name in chat, and you can see all icons associated with your roles in your user profile within the server. The role icon that shows next to someone's name in chat is from their highest role (according to Server Settings > Roles hierarchy).

Have more questions? Check our Help Center article here: https://dis.gd/customroleiconsFAQ

**<:boost:893279428598173747>__New Boost Level Pricing__**

We've reduced the number of boosts for Levels 2 and 3 in Server Boosting by half thanks to feedback from our community. Your servers now need 7 boosts to reach Level 2 and 14 boosts to hit Level 3. It‚Äôs possible that at this new price point your server may already be at a new level. You can see what those new perks are under Server Name > Server Boost.

**üìÜ __Coming Soon: Scheduled Events__**

We‚Äôve just started to roll out a new feature: Scheduled Events. This will allow you to plan ahead and schedule events in Voice or Stage channels as well as a free-form option for events being hosted outside of Discord (link or address) or in a text channel. 

This will be rolling out to 100% of servers over the next few weeks so be on the lookout. For more information check out our Help Center article here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409494125719

**<:serverdiscovery:893279664506798130>  __New Discovery Eligibility__**

Server Discovery member requirement has now dropped from ~~7000~~ to **1000 members.** You can go to ""Server Settings"" > ""Discovery"" to check if your server is now eligible. 

**<:stagechannel:826978986340253726> __Sunset of Stage Discovery__**

Finally, we‚Äôve spent some time assessing our latest feature Stage Discovery and where best to serve our communities moving forward. We have made the decision that **we will be sunsetting Stage Discovery starting on October 4th.** For more info on why we‚Äôve made this decision and what‚Äôs to come for communities for the rest of the year check out our latest blog post here: https://discord.com/blog/whats-next-for-communities-at-discord",0
"Hi Admins and Mods!

**Today we are officially launching Threads,** which can help you and your community organize conversations by topic within a channel. Learn more about this feature in our blog here: https://dis.gd/threads-blog 

**Threads** are both a new means in which your community can engage in conversation and a new surface to consider when moderating servers. So, we wanted to give you a heads up on what this means for your community:

    - Threads can be created from any existing message or from the + icon in the chat bar. Learn the basics in the Threads FAQ Help Center Article here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423
    - We have three new permissions to help you fine-tune which members can create threads, and which channels Threads can be made in. Learn more here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404809613847
    - We‚Äôre initially slow rolling out Threads on Discord, while we monitor performance, but hope to get it to all servers by end of the week. 

‚ö†Ô∏è __**Important**__ ‚ö†Ô∏è 
For now, Threads will not be enabled by default for Community servers. However, once you get access, you will have a new server settings tab on the web or in your client called **‚ÄúThreads Early Access.‚Äù** 

From there, you can turn on Threads by clicking ‚ÄúEnable Threads,‚Äù and customize your Thread permissions for your community (e.g. enable in specific channels or disable for certain roles). 

**Otherwise, on August 17th, Thread permissions will be default-on for all Community servers too. **

Happy üßµing!",0
"Hey Admins and Mods!

We have an exciting announcement for our users in US, CA, GB, and AU (more countries to come soon). 

Today we are officially launching **Stage Discovery,** a quick way for users to browse and join open audio events from all sorts of communities. 

As a Community server, you can now **set your Stage public and allow members from across Discord to listen in on all of the amazing activities happening live in your server.** We think this can be a great way to engage and grow your community. Sing, chat, or learn something new by creating or tuning into a Stage now! 

There‚Äôs a lot more to this new feature, so be sure to read all the details at **https://discord.com/stages** and make sure your event abides by our Stage Guidelines: https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/1500010879761. 

_P.S. On Mobile, Mentions and Quick Switcher have merged into the same tab and there are more exciting things to come üëÄ _",0
"Hey Admins and Mods, 

- üî® üêõ We've fixed a number of bugs with **Membership Screening** on Android v73 and above. Members should no longer get stuck!
-  üìú You can now set a **Server Description in Community Settings > Overview** on web/desktop. It'll show up in your server pop out on web/desktop and mobile.

Thanks!",0
"Hey Admins and Mods,

We're making it easier for you to run audio events in your community!

**Introducing: <:stage:825309164569231361>  Stage channels,** a new type of channel that allow you to share a focused conversation with select speakers to an audience of listeners.
- You can set a topic on the conversation.
- Speakers are shown at the top in the UI.
- All members join as muted listeners by default. No more messing with Speak perms! üö´ 
- Members can raise hand to request to speak. üëã  
- You can designate ""Stage moderators"" who can approve/deny these requests.

In beta testing, we saw communities use Stages for voice AMAs, townhalls, reading clubs where each person talks about their book of choice, and people just singing the night away in karaoke. 

Other important stuff:
- Stage channels are audio only; no video or screen share options currently.
- Up to 1,000 users are able to join Stage channels _for now._
- You can run multiple Stage channels at the same time, similar to current channels.
- It is out on all platforms: iOS, Android, Desktop, and Web. If you don't see it, please update your client.
- Got more Qs? Check out: https://dis.gd/stagesfaq",0
"Hey Admins and Mods! 

You may have heard about a feature for bots currently in beta called **Slash Commands!** Essentially, the way users interact with bots is about to become much simpler - it's as easy as typing ""/"" to bring up all the commands that bot can do. Slash Commands come with features like autocomplete, validation, and error handling. No more typing up memorized commands, which means bots no longer need to read user messages!

We're excited for how this update will unlock more fun with bots, and since we know many of you are careful with where and how you manage bot permissions, we wanted to give you a special heads up on what this is and what small actions you can take today to prepare for the upcoming release.

**What this means for you**
    - We are launching **a new permission: ""Use Slash Commands.""** 
    - Currently, if you've wanted to avoid bot spam in certain channels, you may have turned off read/send message permissions for bots. 
    - However, if those bots use Slash Commands in the future, you'll need to configure this new permission in order to keep your channels consistent with how they're set up today. Otherwise,  Slash Commands may be able to get around your old permissions setups. Commands are sent directly to the bot and not through reading user messages.
    - Go through your channels and decide **where you do and do not want to allow Slash Commands** to be used (yes #botspam, no <#687068339989905449>).

You can see this permission option today on desktop, and on mobile in a few days.

Thanks for all your hard work! 

P.S. Attached is a lil preview of Slash Commands in action.",0
"Hey Admins and Mods,

Today we're excited to share with you a new experiment that we'll be rolling out over the next few weeks. You'll no longer need to settle on choosing **one server region** that your voice channels run on for your whole server. Instead you'll be able to use **a different region** for **each of your voice channels**. 

**But what does this mean for you?**
    - Each of your voice channels will have a voice region setting. **More regions means better call quality** because you're not forcing one region for everyone. 
    - We've also added a new option called ""Automatic."" By default, all voice channel regions will be set to ""Automatic.""  This means that the **region will be _automatically_ determined based on the first person to join an empty voice channel,** and the region can change anytime a voice channel becomes completely empty and new person joins it. 
    - You still **have the option to set a specific region** if you want though. This option will be moving from Server Settings and is now found in each voice channel settings page.

We recommend using the default region, ""Automatic"", so you don't need to constantly change voice channel regions based on who is in a voice channel (Let Discord handle that!), but you're always able to make changes under Voice Channel Settings at any time. 

Also ‚Äî because there's a region setting for each voice channel now means that the permissions to manage this have changed. Instead of granting roles the **Manage Server permission** to change the server region, any roles that have the **Manage Channel permission** will be able to adjust the voice channel region if needed. 

Like we mentioned, this experiment will be rolling out over the next few weeks, and if things look good we'll be swapping over to this system permanently. If you have specific questions around this change, you can check out the Help Center article here: https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360060570993",0
"Hey Admin and Mods,

Today, we are excited to release our new **Rules Screening feature** to all communities. We all know that joining a new community can often be overwhelming and confusing. A great way to help set new members up for success is to outline a set of rules and guidelines that describe your community‚Äôs culture and how one should behave in it. 

Rules Screening gives you a simple, clean way to ensure that potential members can understand the guidelines for your community before joining, helping ensure that they can be positive additions to your community. **If enabled, new members will be prompted to read your rules when they join your server, and until they agree to them and pass your verification level requirements, they will not be able to talk, react, or DM other members.**

For servers that traditionally have not used gating mechanisms (e.g. bot role gate) know that enabling Rules Screening does create more friction to joining and **could lead to a decrease in new member joins.** However, it does offer the least friction possible for anyone who wants new members to agree to rules.

We also know communities often need more sophisticated screening methods like custom response/manual application, oAuth, and third party connections. We are hard at work building those so that we can release them to you soon as well. 

As always, please provide any feedback or comments on these new features so we can help improve them moving forward!

Happy Screening & Happy Holidays. 

_P.S. If you grant roles to new members on join via a bot, it will bypass this feature. We recommend updating your bot to only grant roles once members pass the screening. Look for the `pending` flag in our developer documentation._
_P.S.S If you plan to remove your bot role gate and use Screening, make sure you enable talking perms on @everyone so they can talk after passing. We've already ensured that pending members are not able to talk, dm, or react until they've accepted the rules._",0
your very welcome,0
"This channel has been set up to receive official Discord announcements for admins and moderators of Community servers. We'll let you know about important updates, such as new moderation features or changes to your server's eligibility for Server Discovery, here.

You can change which channel these messages are sent to at any time inside Server Settings. We recommend choosing your staff channel, as some information may be sensitive to your server.

Thanks for choosing Discord as the place to build your community!",0

"Hello Admins & Mods!

It‚Äôs official. 2022 is the year of communities. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve been investing in ways to make it easier to start, grow, and protect your communities on Discord. 

Today, we‚Äôre unveiling new tools and resources fresh from our labs so let‚Äôs dive in.

**It‚Äôs Easy To Keep Your Community And Conversations Clean With AutoMod**

Meet AutoMod, your new best friend in moderation. Designed to reduce work and stress for moderators, AutoMod comes equipped with keyword filters to help keep your server clean and safe around the clock by automatically filtering out harmful or undesirable messages before they‚Äôre posted. Enjoy newfound peace of mind, even when you‚Äôre offline.

Enable AutoMod in **Server Settings > AutoMod**. Once the wheels are turning‚Ä¶

:dot: Choose from readily available keyword filters or customize your own with lists of words or phrases and the actions AutoMod will take when they‚Äôre found in your server.
:dot: AutoMod‚Äôs keyword filters can automatically detect, block, and alert you of messages containing harmful words or phrases‚Äîbefore they‚Äôre ever posted.
:dot: Receive alerts from AutoMod when members try to use words from your lists and assign actions like Timeout from the alert itself.
:dot: Add **Wildcards** to your keywords to detect variations of words that partially match those on your lists. 
     <:bluedot:915338133070032997> `bake*` ‚áí Today, we **bake**d some coffee cake
     <:bluedot:915338133070032997> `*milk` ‚áí I add soy**milk** to my coffee
     <:bluedot:915338133070032997> `*press*` ‚áí A Gibraltar is equal parts es**press**o and milk
:dot: It just works‚Ñ¢Ô∏è on any message sent (i.e., in #text-channels, Threads, Text chat in Voice channels). Check out our Help Center article for all your burning questions. <https://dis.gd/cu-automod-hc>

Your friendly AutoMod is raring to go on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and the web app. Don‚Äôt delay‚Äîemploy your AutoMod today! https://dis.gd/cu-automod-blog

**New Tools To Build Thriving Communities On Discord**

At Discord, we believe anyone can build a thriving community. We‚Äôre excited to share new products and support to help you do so‚Äîcoming sooner than you think.

:dot: Explore a new preview of **Premium Memberships**, bringing customizability to communities and creators platform-wide! <https://dis.gd/cu-community-update>
:dot: Meet **Community Resources**, your one-stop shop for learning how to build your server into a community! Learn to build, engage, grow, and manage a space where anyone can belong. <https://dis.gd/cu-community>
:dot: Chat with your peers in our brand new **Discord Admin Community**, a space where admins, creators, and community managers can connect. <https://dis.gd/cu-meet-admins>

Incredible communities on Discord are built by incredible admins and moderators like you. We can‚Äôt wait to do more together.",0
"**Text Chat in Voice Channels will be enabled automatically for all servers on Wednesday, June 29th** and we‚Äôve made it easier for you to moderate the surface with Discord‚Äôs AutoMod! Here‚Äôs how to make the best of this brand-new feature.

<:dot:890738617130037318> Customize your server‚Äôs Channel and Role permissions and opt-in to *Text Chat in Voice Channels* ahead of time.
<:dot:890738617130037318> Many of your favorite moderation bots support monitoring *Text Chat in Voice Channels* and Discord‚Äôs new AutoMod can automatically detect and flag undesirable messages and rule-breakers before they are posted; helping you keep conversations clean and giving you time to focus on the fun parts of managing your community: (AutoMod Help Center article here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4421269296535-AutoMod-FAQ).
<:dot:890738617130037318> Debut your new *Text Chat In Voice Channels* in your next D&D session or movie night.
<:dot:890738617130037318> Sit back and enjoy a less chaotic <#687068339989905449> with zero context, now that members can send messages within voice channels.

For more details on *Text Chat in Voice Channels* read our Help Center article here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359

We can‚Äôt wait to see how you make the most of *Text Chat In Voice Channels*.",0
"Hey Admins & Mods,

Beginning Wednesday, 6/1 we‚Äôre rolling out **Text Chat in Voice Channels** to Discord. With embedded chat in voice channels, your community can send messages, GIFs, links, memes, etc. to everyone in the voice channel‚Äîno more clogging <#687068339989905449>.

**We are rolling out Text Chat in Voice Channels slowly to all servers throughout the week. Initially, it will not be enabled by default for servers that have greater than 200 members or are set as a Community Server.**

But once you have access‚Ä¶
<:dot:843249351291043851> You‚Äôll have a new Server Settings tab on the web or your client called *Text in Voice*.
<:dot:843249351291043851> Turn Text Chat in Voice Channels on for your community by selecting *Enable*.
<:dot:843249351291043851> Customize permissions for your community, like enabling in specific voice channels or disabling for certain roles. Most developers of your favorite moderation bots have already updated their instances to monitor Text Chat in Voice Channels!

For more details on *Text Chat in Voice Channels*, read our Help Center article here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359

In four weeks, Text Chat in Voice Channels will be automatically enabled for all servers while still respecting your prescribed permissions‚Äîbut we recommend you enable it early for all your server members to enjoy!",0
"Hello Admin & Mods!

Today, we have a new update for slash commands in your servers: **Permissions!** If you don‚Äôt know, slash commands are a new, easier way to use bots on Discord. You might already have some to use‚Äîtype `/` to find out!

With this new system, you can:
<:dot:843249351291043851>Control who can use slash commands in your servers
<:dot:843249351291043851>Control in which channels commands can be used
<:dot:843249351291043851>Sync or unsync commands like channels and categories, making mass management and special cases easy to handle

You can find these permissions in **Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Pick an app!** If the app supports slash commands, you‚Äôll see the UI.

‚ö†Ô∏è If a bot you use has integrated slash commands, the old way of denying the bot Read Messages **will not work to moderate commands usage.** You‚Äôll need to use this new system to control access.

Not sure if your bots support slash commands? Check out in **Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations**, or just **type `/`!**

Check out our blog post to learn more and see a detailed walkthrough: https://discord.com/blog/slash-commands-permissions-discord-apps-bots",0

"This channel has been set up to receive official Discord announcements for admins and moderators of Community servers. We'll let you know about important updates, such as new moderation features or changes to your server's eligibility for Server Discovery, here.

You can change which channel these messages are sent to at any time inside Server Settings. We recommend choosing your staff channel, as some information may be sensitive to your server.

Thanks for choosing Discord as the place to build your community!",0

"I really love Evan Du. Like, a lot. Like, a whole lot. You have no idea. I love him so much that it is inexplicable, and I'm ninety-nine percent sure that I have an unhealthy obsession. I will never get tired of listening that sweet, angelic voice of his. It is my life goal to meet up him in real life and just say hello to him.

I fall asleep at night dreaming of him holding a personal concert for me, and then he would be so tired that he comes and cuddles up to me while we sleep together. If I could just hold him hand for a brief moment, I could die happy. If given the opportunity, I would lightly nibble on him ear just to hear what kind of sweet moans he would let out. Then, I would hug him while he clings to my body hoping that I would stop, but I only continue as he moans louder and louder.

I would give up almost anything just for him to look in my general direction. No matter what I do, I am constantly thinking of him. When I wake up, he is the first thing on my mind. When I go to school, I can only focus on him. When I go come home, I go on the computer so that I can listen to him beautiful voice. When I go to sleep, I dream of him and I living a happy life togethim. He is my pride, passion, and joy. If he were to call me ""Onii-chan,"" I would probably get diabetes from him sweetness and die.

I wish for nothing but his happiness. If it were for him, I would give my life without any second thoughts. Without him, my life would serve no purpose. I really love Evan Du.",0

When I go to sleep, I dream of him and I living a happy life togethim. He is my pride, passion, and joy. If he were to call me ""Onii-chan,"" I would probably get diabetes from him sweetness and die.

I wish for nothing but his happiness. If it were for him, I would give my life without any second thoughts. Without him, my life would serve no purpose. I really love Evan Du.",0
"I really love Evan Du. Like, a lot. Like, a whole lot. You have no idea. I love him so much that it is inexplicable, and I'm ninety-nine percent sure that I have an unhealthy obsession. I will never get tired of listening that sweet, angelic voice of his. It is my life goal to meet up him in real life and just say hello to him.

I fall asleep at night dreaming of him holding a personal concert for me, and then he would be so tired that he comes and cuddles up to me while we sleep together. If I could just hold him hand for a brief moment, I could die happy. If given the opportunity, I would buy him flowers!!
